#include <stdio.h> 
int main() 
{ 
    int c = 4; 
    c = c++ + ~++c; 
    printf("%d", c); 
    return (0); 
} 
Options:
1. 3
2. -3
3. 31
4. compile time error

 The answer is option(2).
Explanation:Because here c++ is post increment and so it takes value as 4 then it will increment. ++c is pre-increment so it increment first and value 6 is assigned to c, .~ means -6-1=-7 then c=(4-7)=-3.

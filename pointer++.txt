int main() 
{ 
   char str[]= "geeks\nforgeeks"; 
   char *ptr1, *ptr2; 
       
   ptr1 = &str[3]; 
   ptr2 = str + 5; 
   printf("%c", ++*str - --*ptr1 + *ptr2 + 2);  
   printf("%s", str);  
   
   getchar(); 
   return 0; 
} 
Output:
heejs
forgeeks

Explanation:
Initially ptr1 points to ‘k’ and ptr2 points to ‘\n’ in “geeks\nforgeeks”. In print statement value at str is incremented by 1 and value at ptr1 is decremented by 1. So string becomes “heejs\nforgeeks” .

First print statement becomes
printf(“%c”, ‘h’ – ‘j’ + ‘n’ + 2)

‘h’ – ‘j’ + ‘\n’ + 2 = -2 + ‘\n’ + 2 = ‘\n’



#include<stdio.h> 

int main() 
{ 
	int x = 20, *y, *z; 
	
	// Assume address of x is 500 and 
	// integer is 4 byte size 
	y = &x; 
	z = y; 
	*y++; 
	*z++; 
	x++; 
	printf("x = %d, y = %u, z = %d \n", x, y, z); 
	return 0; 
} 
Output:

x=21 y=504 z=504
Description:
In the beginning, the address of x is assigned to y and then y to z, it makes y and z similar. when the pointer variables are incremented there value is added with the size of the variable, in this case, y and z are incremented by 4.

First print statements newline character. and next print statement prints “heejs\nforgeeks”.
